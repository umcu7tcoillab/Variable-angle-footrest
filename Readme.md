# Variable footrest


## The design
This project contains a variable footrest created for MRI experiments. 

The angle of the footrest can be adjusted between 4 different angles: 10, 15, 20 and 25 degrees. The curve on the bottom of the frontplate fits exactly in a Philips MR bed.

It is designed to be lasercut from a sheet of 5mm plastic. M8 bolts are needed to fasten the nuts.
